# aquabsd-builder

Say hello to Bob the builder üë∑

Bob the builder will help you create aquaBSD images.
A C library is provided for you to create images programmatically, similar to a `Dockerfile` but more powerful (and less straightforward üòõ).

## Compilation

## Usage

Bob the builder always enjoys giving a hand!
Don't be afraid to ask him to build an installer image by invoking him:

```shell
% sh bob.sh
```

He'll fetch the required resources to build your image if you don't already have them under `dist/`.
